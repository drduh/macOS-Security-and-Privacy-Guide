# Basics

* Configure system and software updates to automatically download and install. See [Keep your Mac up to date](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-mac-up-to-date-mchlpx1065) or use `softwareupdate` to configure options.
* Encrypt data at rest with [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785) volume encryption. Use a [password manager](https://support.apple.com/105115) to guard and manage credentials.
* Create scheduled [backups](https://support.apple.com/104984) of important data. Practice [recovery](https://support.apple.com/102551) in the event of a compromise.
* Avoid third party software; if necessary, only install from official sources indicated by trusted developers.
